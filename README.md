Quick Things About Me!

- My nationality is Dominican; born and raised in Manhattan, NY.

- My career goals are to do something that scares me yet excites me, and make money doing what I've always loved and always wanted to do.

- I chose FinTech as a career path because I have more than a decade in Finance through Banking and Investment Firms, but have always strived to approach my professional client base with genuine care through education and innovative approaches; technology offers various tools and resources that can be leveraged correctly to execute real life solutions with meaningful impact.

I have no idea what's in store for me the next twenty-three and so upcoming weeks but **excited**! to see what lies next! - Alexis Reyes aka
