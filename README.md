My nationality is Dominican; born and raised in Manhattan, NY.

My career goals are to do something that scares me yet excites me, and make money doing what I've always loved and always wanted to do.

I chose FinTech as a career path because I have more than a decade in Finance through Banking and Investment Firms, but have always strived to approach my professional client base with genuine care through education and innovative approaches; technology offers various tools and resources that can be leveraged correctly to execute real life solutions with meaningful impact.
