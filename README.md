## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 

The specific financial problem that Klarna is trying to solve is empowering consumers to make purchases without immediate payment. The process and business model aims to simplify the preference of payment method, within Klarna's flexible payment arrangements under offered terms and conditions, without any additional fees or contigencies by using their services.


* Who is the company's intended customer? 

Any demographic customer; with special focus placed on traditional online shoppers, Gen Z and Millenials consumers whom are considered tech-savvy and comfortable with digital transactions, often seeking as preferred method of convenience.   

Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

There are 5.6 billion consumers in the world today. The largest consumer markets are China, United States, and Japan. 

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Most if not all companies often demand payment when attempting to pay for goods or services either in A: Immediate payment in the form of cash or fiat. B: Special financing, if offered, through the merchant directly or preferred partner. As consumers, despite their willingness to fulfill payment as advertised for, are subject to merchant specific payment methods. This perceivable restriction reduces a consumers ultimate buying power thus the absence of such flexible payment methods like Buy Now, Pay Later create an unfavorable buyer's market.
