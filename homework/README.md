### *Remember as a kid trading anything of value for a piece of gum?*

  > If it wasn't giving up your candy, perhaps it was an offered agreement garnished by a honorable handshake to give up your chocolate milkbox for the next 5 school day lunch breaks. As juveniles, when we wanted to receive or acquire something of value, the obvious absence of money forced us to think of creative and clever ways to bid and a satisfy whichever seller's ask; in consideration of our inability to pay outright or satisfy the sellers demands at any encountered opportunity to purchase. 
  
  > One company decided to incorporate the same fundamental rules applicable in the playground or lunch caferias worldwide, through a simple, digitial offering by the name of Klarna. 
  
### *Who is Klarna?*

  > The company was founded and incorporated on 2005 by three individuals named Sebastian Siemiatkkowski, Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsson. The idea for the company came about by identifying ways to distrupt traditional shopping and offer alternative payment solutions. The founders sought to revolutionize the way people pay for goods and services by offering flexible payment plan options prior to completed checkout. In their near two decades worth of experience developing and innovating this financial space, Klarna unlike other similar competitors and peers, is not publicly traded and receives its company capitalization through private funding. The company, whom measures and tracks their business revenue originating from their preferred measured unit, "...Gross merchandise value (GMV) ... total worth of stuff that customer bought using Klarna services." Per their recent quarterly report in 2023, Klarna's revenue, as measured in GMV, announced a percentage increase of 13% or $19.65 Billion USD in comparison to last year. 1

*If it wasn't your candy, perhaps it was an agreement of lunch snacks every day from the vending machine for a week.

# Business Activities

*A Solution To A Problem You Never Knew You Had...*

<<<<<<< HEAD
> The specific financial problem that Klarna is trying to solve is empowering consumers to make purchases without immediate payment. The process and business model aims to simplify the preference of payment method, within Klarna's flexible payment arrangements under offered terms and conditions, without any additional fees or contigencies by using their services. 2

*The audience is there already...*

> Any demographic customer; with special focus placed on traditional online shoppers, Gen Z and Millenials consumers whom are considered tech-savvy and comfortable with digital transactions, often seeking as preferred method of convenience.

*Amongst the masses and millions...*

>Did you know there are over 5.6 billion consumers in the world today? The largest consumer markets that participate and exist in the global economy are China, United States, and Japan.

*An opportunity to disrupt...*

> Most if not all companies often demand payment when attempting to pay for goods or services either in A: Immediate payment in the form of cash or fiat. B: Special financing, if offered, through the merchant directly or preferred partner. As consumers, despite their willingness to fulfill payment as advertised for, are subject to merchant specific payment methods. This perceivable restriction reduces a consumers ultimate buying power thus the absence of such flexible payment methods like Buy Now, Pay Later create an unfavorable buyer's market. 3

# Results
*Disrupting an industry vs. Real-life impact* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

  > Klarna has been able to create a solution to a problem that didn't necessarily need to be solved to begin with. While economy and marketplaces thrive in  favorable conditions intentionally designed to drive business, payment was walternative solution. By engineering this disruptive yet intuitive convenient financing option, whilst leveraging coordinated merchant relationships, Klarna has been able to capture a significant market share in the overall e-commerce world. Everyday in Stockholm since 2005, Klarna's efforts like its targeted relationships to make online shopping even more easy, helped catipult it into the driver's seat as market leader amd market maker of sorts. Although it thrives as a non-traditional financial institutition, any participant within the world of finance and commerce understands the fundamental units and measurables to evidence activity, transactional volumes, and other relavant metrics. Klarna despite losing much of their peak valuation post-pandemic still maintains and boasts its captured market share such as being,  "...one of Europe's largest banks with 90,000,000 customers, over 200,000 merchants, and at least 1,000,000 transactions a day." 6 So while Klarna can't boast any longer their once proud $45.6 Billion valuation 7 

*Alas, competition can be stiff...*

  > Klarna’s major competitors within the same payments solutions domain include but not limited to: Affirm, AfterPay, PayPal and Apple. The latter of the list has recently incorporated the Pay Later feature built-in part of their iOS core firmware update to millions of Apple device users, to fortify their financial technology suite of solutions notably led by their digital contactless payment service. Two of the former, notably Affirm and AfterPay, are vehemently focused on utilizing and optimizing the same BPNL strategy; AfterPay is Australian based launched in 2014 with relative modest user base compared to Klarna whilst Affirm serves as the formidable foe, as a publicly traded mid-cap company, whom like Klarna has prioritized and leveraged strategic partnerships with e-Commerce platforms such as Walmart, Amazon and Shopify. 8

# Recommendations 

*If you build it, will they do it?*

  > If hypothetically offered the privilege and ability to advise Klarna on the company direction and strategy, I would suggest they incentive their business model with membership tiered relationships for customers to become recurring clients. While the prospect of paying off something like a large purchase or non-essential, self-indulging luxury item with time rather than absorb the swift brunt of a multi digit debit of available monies, it would be the entity’s responsibility to not only their customer base but stockholders, to foster continued service usage, reward loyal users, alongside incentivize further utilization. Forbes magazine published a news bit in their innovation section, highlighting  “…79% of consumers look for deals in loyalty rewards programs before buying an item”  7

  > I believe that offering this service feature would benefit the company because consumers understand the basic logic of exchange in something of value for goods or services. With the exception of gifts, charity, or any other similar form of philanthropy, any tangible item with inherent value is naturally associated with a cost to measure or acquire; the distinguishing difference of volume received in the aforementioned exchange is which merchant or vendor uses intangibles and creativity wisely to create a fruitful ecosystem.

  > While this reward incentive strategy has been used before by traditional financial institutions and other pillars functioning within capitalism, Klarna, like many other FinTech companies, are emboldened and lauded for their ability to not only expectedly innovate but disrupt the financial arena for the better. While data and predictive machine learning algorithms nowadays empower companies with reliable information to guide future business plans, campaign strategies and marketing promotions, the fundamental psychology associated with why people purchase things are what environmental factors may heighten or reduce their probability to successfully purchase is the true ___. This can be accomplished by tapping into modern support resources like artificial intelligence . 

*Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?*
 
  > In the realm of payment solutions and commerce, any malleable method
